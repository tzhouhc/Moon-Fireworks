# Moon-Fireworks
This is a simple color scheme I created that is compatible with most if not all text editors that uses tmTheme files as color scheme definitions. It is designed to be cheerful and vibrant while not seeming overly 'jumpy'. It actually makes the keywords bold and comments italic! Yay.
